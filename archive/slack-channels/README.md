Hi @channel, the Slack system will be up to 22 June. I think you all
agree that it is better to preserve all the amount of information that
we have exchanged during these 2 months. For this reason, I write a
brief procedure to save the history for a channel

1. Install
https://dashhackathon.slack.com/apps/A19P6G35Y-export
2. Excute the command '/export' in a Slack channel
3. Click on 'Click here to begin the export process' that will appear
   as a message
4. Choose the format (JSON seems to work fine) and click 'Export'
5. Wait and download the channel history in the chosen format.

If everyone backups its channel, we could preserve a lot of
information. We would be also interested to analyze the activity in the
different channels and do some statistics on them.
